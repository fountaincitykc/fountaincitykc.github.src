- name: Alex Davis
  role: Worship Leader
  email: alex@fountaincitykc.org
  contentHTML: "<p>A KC native, Alex studied worship arts at John Brown University: a combination of worship philosophy, church history, theology, and music performance focused on voice and guitar. He spent his spare time working in the performing arts center's recording studio, rounding out the technical side of worship training.</p>
  <p>Alex loves seeing how the rhythms of the church calendar align with the life season of our church and how that all shapes our corporate worship during service. Each week we are able to \"sing to the Lord a new song\", rejoice, confess, and pray together without falling into rote worship because His mercies are always new.</p>
  <p>Alex married Kathryn, his high school friends and college sweetheart, and they now live in Overland Park with their cat Imogene.</p>"

  <p>Risha's love for family ministry grew in her home as she witnessed the love and grace of God work powerfully in her family. Risha was raised in Texas and studied Journalism at Texas A&amp;M University before moving to Kansas City, where she met her husband, Mark, in their adjoining backyards. After marriage, they became a blended family with four children under three years old. Now that her children are nearly grown, Risha feels she can relate to the struggles many parents experience and she looks forward to sharing the hope of Christ with families.</p>
