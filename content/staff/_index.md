  email: alex@fountaincitykc.org
  content: "A KC native, Alex studied worship arts at John Brown University: a combination of worship philosophy, church history, theology, and music performance focused on voice and guitar. He spent his spare time working in the performing arts center’s recording studio, rounding out the technical side of worship training.\n\n
  Alex loves seeing how the rhythms of the church calendar align with the life season of our church and how that all shapes our corporate worship during service. Each week we are able to “sing to the Lord a new song”, rejoice, confess, and pray together without falling into rote worship because His mercies are always new.\n\n
  Alex married Kathryn, his high school friends and college sweetheart, and they now live in Overland Park with their cat Imogene."
