  contentHTML: "<p>As we begin a brief new series through Jonah, one of realities we'll experience is that Jonah is kind of like a mirror. From the start this can be uncomfortable because Jonah, like all of us, has some \"worst moments\". Moments in his life he would like to forget because of what he did or the choice he made. What Jonah's story will show us is that these moments are not the end of things for us; that's because of one life-changing reality: God's mercy and grace.</p>"
