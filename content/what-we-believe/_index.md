title: What we believe
---

All Scripture is self-attesting and being Truth, requires our unreserved submission in all areas of life.
The infallible Word of God, the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is a complete and
unified witness to God’s redemptive acts culminating in the incarnation of the Living Word, the Lord
Jesus Christ. The Bible, uniquely and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the supreme and final
authority on all matters on which it speaks.

On this sure foundation we affirm these additional Essentials of our faith.

1. We believe in one God, the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all things, infinitely perfect and
eternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To Him be all honor, glory and
praise for ever!

2. Jesus Christ, the living Word, became flesh through His miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit
and His virgin birth. He who is true God became true man united in one Person forever. He died
on the cross a sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures. On the third day He arose bodily
from the dead, ascended into heaven, where, at the right hand of the Majesty on High, He now is
our High Priest and Mediator.

3. The Holy Spirit has come to glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to our hearts.
He convicts us of sin and draws us to the Savior. Indwelling our hearts, He gives new life to us,
empowers and imparts gifts to us for service. He instructs and guides us into all truth, and seals us
for the day of redemption.

4. Being estranged from God and condemned by our sinfulness, our salvation is wholly dependent
upon the work of God’s free grace. God credits His righteousness to those who put their faith in
Christ alone for their salvation, and thereby justifies them in His sight. Only such as are born of
the Holy Spirit and receive Jesus Christ become children of God and heirs of eternal life.

5. The true Church is composed of all persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ and the
sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit are united together in the body of Christ. The Church finds
her visible, yet imperfect, expression in local congregations where the Word of God is preached
in its purity and the sacraments are administered in their integrity, where scriptural discipline is
practiced, and where loving fellowship is maintained. For her perfecting, she awaits the return of
her Lord.

6. Jesus Christ will come again to the earth–personally, visibly, and bodily–to judge the living and
the dead, and to consummate history and the eternal plan of God. “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”
(Rev. 22:20)

7. The Lord Jesus Christ commands all believers to proclaim the gospel throughout the world and to
make disciples of all nations. Obedience to the Great Commission requires total commitment to
“Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.” He calls us to a life of self-denying love and
service. “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10)
