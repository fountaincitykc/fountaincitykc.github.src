title: What we believe
---

<p>
  All Scripture is self-attesting and being Truth, requires our unreserved submission in all areas of life. The infallible Word of God, the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, is a complete and unified witness to God’s redemptive acts culminating in the incarnation of the Living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible, uniquely and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the supreme and final authority on all matters on which it speaks. On this sure foundation we affirm these Essentials:
</p>
<h4>
  1. God
</h4>
<p>
  We believe in one God, the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all things. God is infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
</p>
<h4>
  2. Jesus
</h4>
<p>
  Jesus Christ, the living Word, became flesh when he was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born to Mary, a virgin, thus fulfilling what Scripture promises. Jesus is fully God and fully human. He died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sin. On the third day, he arose bodily from the dead and ascended into heaven. Now, he is seated at the right hand of God the Father, and he intercedes for us as our High Priest and Mediator.
</p>
<h4>
  3. The Holy Spirit
</h4>
<p>
  The Holy Spirit has come to glorify Jesus Christ and to apply the saving work of Jesus to our hearts. He convicts us of sin and draws us to the Savior. Indwelling our hearts, he gives new life to us, empowers and imparts gifts to us for service. He instructs and guides us into all truth, and seals us for the day of redemption.
</p>
<h4>
  4. Humanity
</h4>
<p>
  Being estranged from God and condemned by our sinfulness, our salvation is wholly dependent upon the work of God’s free grace. God credits his righteousness to those who put their faith in Jesus alone for their salvation, thereby justifies them in his sight. Only such as are born of the Holy Spirit and receive Jesus Christ become children of God and heirs of eternal life.
</p>
<h4>
  5. The Bible
</h4>
<p>
  All Scripture is self-attesting and, as Truth, requires our unreserved submission in all areas of life. The infallible Word of God, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is a complete and unified witness to God’s redemptive acts culminating in the incarnation of the Living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible, uniquely and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the supreme and final authority on all matters on which it speaks. It is also the Holy Spirit’s primary means of transforming lives.
</p>
<h4>
  6. The Church
</h4>
<p>
  The true Church is composed of all persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit are united together in the body of Christ. The Church finds her visible, yet imperfect, expression in local congregations where the Word of God is preached in its purity and the sacraments are administered in their integrity, where scriptural discipline is practiced, and where loving fellowship is maintained. For her perfecting, she awaits the return of her Lord.
</p>
<h4>
  7. The Christian Life
</h4>
<p>
  Jesus Christ will come again to the earth—personally, visibly, and bodily—to judge the living and the dead and to consummate history and the eternal plan of God. “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” (Rev. 22:20).
</p>
<p>
  The Lord Jesus Christ commands all believers to proclaim the gospel throughout the world and to make disciples of all nations. Obedience to the Great Commission requires total commitment to “him who loved us and gave himself for us.” He calls us to a life of self-denying love and service. “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10)
